#### CDK Constructs
- Have the signature `(scope, id, props)`
- Are the basic building block of CDK apps.
- Constructs are always created in the scope of another construct and must always have an identifier which must be unique within the scope it’s created.


  - `scope`: the first argument is always the scope in which this construct is created. 
  - `id`: the second argument is the local identity of the construct.
  - `props`: the last (sometimes optional) argument is always a set of initialization properties.
